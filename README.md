# Backpressure
This project is the ninth part of a series of 10 articles about RxJava operators. It demonstrates the backpressure problem and how to deal with it by using some ordinary operators as well as some specific operators. It also shows how to use reactive pull and manual request approaches in order to have more control on how/when items are requested.

Please, refer to [this article](http://androidahead.com/2018/01/30/rxjava-operators-part-9-backpressure/) for detailed information.
